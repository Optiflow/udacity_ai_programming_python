# Coursework for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree Program
Implementation of transfer learning with pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to develop flowers image classifier with PyTorch.

## Building Custom Image Classification
- _train.py_ contains the necessary codes to import pre-trained CNN, either VGG19 or Alexnet, and replace last Fully Connected Layer (FCL) to train custom image classification. 
- User should provide own images for customised image classification and update the folder path in _train.py_. 
- Ground truth of image should be provided in JSON format.

## Model Output
- The model will return the top 5 predicted flower type based on input image.
